# ng2-aot - Working Angular2 demo app with AoT and lazy routes
Inspired from @ngtools/webpack internal tests, this little Angular2 app
shows how to AoT compile with lazy routes.

## Structure
- webpack@2.1.0.beta-22
- angular2@2.2.1
- @ngtools/webpack@1.1.6

## Key points
While using the AoT Plugin looks simple, there are _many_ caveats to watch for, that
may totally compromise the build.
